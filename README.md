# COVID-19-Time-Series-Forecasting

- In this Project I had used time series forecasting technique of machine
learning to predict the future confirmed cases for 7 days of COVID-19 using "fbprophet" library , which is built by the "Facebook" for the purpose of time-series analysis.
-> Tools & Softwares that i have used while building this project :-
1) Google Colab
2) Numpy
3) Pandas
4) Python
5) Fbprophet

- Here i have used two data sets, I have not uploaded those datasets in this repository because i can't update them daily.
  So, here i will tell you about the source of those datasets :-
1) Covid cases in india.xlsx :- I have taken this dataset from "https://www.mohfw.gov.in/" this website.This dataset is required to analye the performance of indian 
states against COVID-19.
2) covid_cases.csv :- This dataset is used in forecasting the future covid-19 cases. I have taken this dataset from "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series".
